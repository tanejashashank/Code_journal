CASE statements (IF-ELSE-Then)

Contains a WHEN, THEN, and ELSE statement, finished with END

For example:
CASE WHEN x = 1 THEN 'A'
	 WHEN x = 2 THEN 'B'
	 ELSE 'C' 
	 END AS new_column;
	 

We can use AND statements within WHEN statement

For example:
CASE WHEN x = 1 AND y = 1 THEN 'A'
	 WHEN x = 2 AND y = 2 THEN 'B'
	 ELSE 'C' 
	 END AS new_column;
	 
	 
We can filter the columns using CASE statements in WHERE clause. No need to add alias to the CASE statement while using it as filter.

SELECT *
FROM Table
WHERE 
	CASE WHEN x = 1 AND y = 1 THEN 'A'
		 WHEN x = 2 AND y = 2 THEN 'B'
		 END IS NOT NULL
		 
CASE statements are like any other column in your table, so you can include them in aggregate statements too.

SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Round the percentage of tied games to 2 decimal points
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END),2) AS pct_ties_2013_2014,
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END),2) AS pct_ties_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
